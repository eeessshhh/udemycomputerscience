If you have n light bulbs, you can store 2^n units of information.
So 1 light bulb, then two signals (on and off)
2 light bulbs, then four signals(ON-ON, ON-OFF, OFF-ON, OFF-OFF)
It exponentially increases.

Generations of Computers:
1. Vaccuum tubes
2. Transistors
3. Integrated circuits
4. Microprocessors
5. AI

Moore's Law: Processing power doubles every 18 months.

Circuits, switches, gates, transistors all refer to a thing inside the computer
which can be either ON or OFF. 

Zeroes and Ones are called binary digits or also known as "bits".
8 bits = 1 byte.
1000 bytes = 1kb
1000kb = 1MB
1000MB = 1GB
1000GB = 1TB

We write programs and then that programming language gets translated to machine language. Machine language is nothing but bits (binary digits).

You can search "System Information" and find out about the properties of your computer.

Counting in Binary:
So how do you write the number 36 in binary?
That's .
So here's how to count. Assume we are starting from 2^0 and going upto 2 ^7. 
Think of it as counting in dollars. So we need 36 dollars.
 
2^7    2^6    2^5   2^4    2^3   2^2   2^1  2^0   digit
128th  64th   32nd  sixt  eight  four  two  one     

                                        1           2
                                        1     1     3
                            1      1    1     0     14
                1     0     0      1    0     0     36

Ok so I hope you understand that.
